Messing around in p5.js + trying out some OOP in js.

Prototype of a lightning attack that would fit Diablo-like game. It should
be a crowd control/AoE attack.

It chooses the next target and applies damage, up to a number of targets
specified by the spellLevel var. It chooses the target semi-randomly,
with high probability to choose the closest target, but sometimes choosing
second, third or fourth closes target just for the feeling of it.

The attack was designed to be simple to implement, yet fun to use, with
a good sense of progression in leveling the spell's level.

Visualisation in p5.js.
